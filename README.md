- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victoria, an English into Brazilian Portuguese translator.
- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are she/her.
- ðŸŒ± I specialize in health/well-being, culinary, and fashion.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm on GitHub because when I was a student, I created a translation agency's website using HTML and CSS.
This website was localized into Brazilian Portuguese by me for educational purposes. Now, I want to deploy it
to showcase my work :)
